# PROBABALL

Probaball is a quantitative development project focused on predictive modeling in sports analytics. The tool estimates the probability of a baseball team winning a given game based on its batting order and starting pitcher. By combining statistical modeling, monte-carlo simulations, and domain-specific features such as player performance metrics, handedness matchups, and historical outcomes, Probaball aims to capture the nuanced interactions that influence game results. The project serves as both a practical application of quantitative finance-style modeling techniques and a demonstration of end-to-end model development, from data collection and feature engineering, to backtesting and performance evaluation.
